      <p>Wireframing is a quick and effective way to identify usability issues early on in your design process. Wireframes are a great tool to get your clients to focus on what you want them to think about early in the design process. Wireframes are a great way to walk clients and stakeholders through the structure of your designs without giving them a chance to get distracted by colors and images. If the goal of your meeting is to get your clients to think about what elements should be on the page and how those elements will function on the site, simply taking out colors, images, and stylized pages makes it much more straightforward. You can then easily gather feedback from your client and stakeholders on the site’s navigation and allocation of elements on the pages. rather than them focusing on how the color red is “just not working for them” as a call-to-action button. It sounds funny, but it happens a lot!<br><br>Wireframes are a great way to prioritize content by helping reveal space constraints and designing the hierarchy of elements on the page. Having the opportunity early on to to visualize the hierarchy of your pages and begin visually displaying the space constraints will save you a lot of time later when you begin stylizing the pages and filling them with content. You should be gathering feedback on your wireframes from stakeholders, quickly moving things around on your wireframes based on the feedback you receive, gather feedback again, and iterate until you reach your intended goal.</p>

      <p>The main function of typography in web design is to make all the content on the website appear interesting. Once interest is sparked, the right choice of font, typeface, color, and other typography elements can make the content on the website legible to users. After these two feats are achieved, engaging users and convincing them to browse for longer periods on the site becomes much easier. Good typography is also essential and critical for boosting a website’s accessibility. Choosing easy-to-read fonts, effective use of whitespace, and other typography tricks can make any website ten times more accessible to all types of users.<br><br> Effective typography can help web designers create and reflect a strong brand identity for their websites. Designers can thoughtfully select fonts and typefaces that unequivocally reflect the brand value. They can alter the design hierarchy to produce a harmonious visual experience on the site.<br><br>Typography has always been an essential element of graphic design and it will always be one of the core principles of good website design. That is because without good typography no piece of content is readable or visually appealing. So, if you want your web design to be engaging for users, improving its typography should be your priority!</p>

      <p>We often think that silence, emptiness, or colorlessness is bad for us. We take them for granted without thinking that they are the solid foundation of the contrast. Only silence lets us know the value of the sound. Only empty space lets us understand what we want to fill it with. Only colorlessness lets us feel the colors brighter and deeper when they appear on stage. And only the absence of air lets us know how vital it is.<br><br>Basically, negative space – or white space, as it’s often called – is the area of the layout that is left empty. It may be not only around the objects you place in the layout but also between and inside them. Negative space is a kind of breathing room for all the objects on the page or screen. Not only does it define the limits of objects but it also creates the necessary bonds between them according to Gestalt principles and builds up effective visual performance. Due to that, white space is a rightful design element that has a big impact on positive user experience. “White space is like a canvas: it’s the background that holds the elements together in a design, enabling them to stand out” – says Mads Soegaard from Interaction Design Foundation.</p>
